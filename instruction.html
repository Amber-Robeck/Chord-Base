      <h3>Verticle Lines</h3>

      <p>When you read a guitar chord diagram, it’s showing you your guitar from a sideways point of view.The first point is the vertical lines. The vertical lines represent the strings on your guitar. The far-left line represents the thickest string on your guitar (low E) and the far-right line represents the thinnest string on your guitar (high E).</p>

      <h3>Horizontal Lines</h3>
      <img src="https://guitargearfinder.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/guitar-chord-diagram-frets.jpg">
      <p>horizontal lines represent the frets on your guitar with the thickest top line representing the guitar nut.
        In the above photo, you should be able to see how the frets match up to the lines in the diagram.</p>

      <h3>Numbers</h3>

       <p> The numbers on the black dots or below the chord diagram tell us which fingers to use to play the notes.
        sometimes the numbers are shown on the black dots, sometimes they’re shown below the diagram, and sometimes they’re not shown at all. If a diagram doesn’t show you any numbers, you should place your fingers wherever they feel comfortable to play the chord.</p>

      <h3>Black Dots</h3>
       <img src="https://guitargearfinder.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/guitar-chord-diagram-numbers.jpg">
       <p>The black dots show you where to place your fingers on the guitar fretboard. The first dot is on the first fret on the second (B) string. The second dot is on the second fret on the fourth (D) string. The third dot is on the third fret on the fifth (A) string. The above diagram is telling us we need to use three fingers to play this chord.</p>
