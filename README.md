# Welcome to Chord-Base!

Do you want to learn the guitar? Why pay 20 dollars an hour for an instructor when we have a great free app for you. The point of this application is to help teach someone the basics of guitar and playing guitar chords. This app isn't just for beginners. Intermediate guitar players are also welcome to use this app to refresh there memory with certain chords that they don't quite have down yet. This application is meant to be interactive in the sense that you can click on any chord you want to learn, and a diagram will pop up showing you how to play said chord. We also incorporated a tone button that you can click and hear the sound of the chord that you are trying to play. Fret no more! Learning guitar is easier than 1,2,3! 

## AS A USER
* I want an app that is interactive and easy to use with simple instructions on how to play guitar chords. 
* When I open the webpage I would like to be presented with options to select which chord I would like to learn. 
* I would also like to be presented with a diagram of the chord so that I can visually see it and do it on my own.
* I would also like to hear the chord out loud so that I can compare my own playing to the tone coming from the application so that I know I am playing the chord correctly. 
* As a beginner I may not know where to even start.. So for this reason I would like if there was an instructional page that teaches me the basics of finger placement and how to read a diagram.
